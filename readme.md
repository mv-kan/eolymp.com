# eolymp.com problems in c/c++

this is my attempt at problems at eolymp.com

## Problems

```
1 -> ok
20 -> ok. Grade is C, but I have no idea how you can make it more optimized. (https://www.eolymp.com/ru/submissions/15006149)
21 -> On hold. I couldn't finish it, because I have no good solution for it, because it is not greedy algorithm, I suppose it is dynamic programming problem and I don't know it yet. (https://www.eolymp.com/en/submissions/15000768)
